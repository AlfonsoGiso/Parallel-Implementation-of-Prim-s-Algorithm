# Parallel-Implementation-of-Prim-s-Algorithm
The goal of the project is to implement and analyze the parallel version of the Prim’s Algorithm. This algorithm deals with finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected and non oriented graph. Given the sequential version of the Prim’s algorithm, the project has faced the problem using two different approaches: MPI+OpenMP and CUDA+OpenMP
